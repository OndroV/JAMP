**J**ust **A**nother **M**etabarcoding **P**ipeline - by Vasco Elbrecht - Twitter @luckylionde

JAMP is a modular metabarcoding pipeline, integrating different functions from USEARCH, VSEARCH, CUTADAPT and other programs. The pipeline is run as an R package and automatically generates the needed folders and summary statistics. 

I am still working on the documentation, and the package is in **beta** thus if you run into issues or have questions please contact me per e-mail (luckylion07@googlemail.com).

For a a short tutorial on extracting haplotypes from metabarcoding datasets take a look at the [denoising quick guide](https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP/wiki/3)-Denoising-quick-guide!).
