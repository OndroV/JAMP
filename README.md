**J**ust **A**nother **M**etabarcoding **P**ipeline - by Vasco Elbrecht - Twitter @luckylionde

Work in progress, I just started programming this R package.

This is an imporvied easy to use metabarcdoing rstats pipeline, we use @leeselab. It relies on USEARCH and is intended to be used on LINUX / MAC OS. It's fully modular and optimised for our fusion primer metabarcoding system.

At this point it is intended for internal @leeselab use ONLY, as it is in active development (and far from beeing complete). However, if you like to give it a try feel free to do so! I am happy to give you support should you run into issues (luckyLion07@googlemail.com).


For a a short tutorial on extracting haplotypes from metabarcoding datasets take a look at the [denoising quick guide](https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP/wiki/3)-Denoising-quick-guide!).
